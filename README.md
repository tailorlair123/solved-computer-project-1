Assignment BackgroundWhen air moves across exposed skin, humans perceive the temperature to be colder than the measured air temperature. The National Weather Service uses a formula to quantify that perception:The NWS Wind Chill Temperature (WCT) index uses advances in science, technology, and computer modeling to provide an accurate, understandable, and useful formula for calculating the dangers from winter winds and freezing temperatures.Additional information, including the formula for calculating the WCT index, is available at: <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/winter/windchill.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/winter/windchill.shtml</a>
